### GEO App

GEO App is a MERN stack application that allows one to maintain a list of preferred restaurants, sort of as a personal bookmark manager for resturants. Its core functionality is that of adding/removing/updating restaurants to the list. All restaurants are composed of the following fields:

- name
- description
- rating (a number from 1 to 5)
- location

This is the repository for the front-end part of the application. The front-end is a react based SPA (single page application) which depends on an API for providing the CRUD functionality. Except for displaying and allowing the user to add/update more data, the front end also uses Google Maps to display a restaurant (once clicked on it) in the map.

# The core technologies:
